    // and place it in a new file named "Secrets.swift".
    //
    // 1. Create a new file in your project: File -> New -> File -> Swift File
    // 2. Name it "Secrets.swift"
    // 3. Add the following content to Secrets.swift:
    //
    //    struct Secrets {
    //        static let openWeatherMapAPIKey = "YOUR_NEW_API_KEY_HERE"
    //    }
    //
    // This `Secrets.swift` file is already listed in your .gitignore and will not be committed.
    
    // The app will now securely access the key from the untracked Secrets.swift file.
