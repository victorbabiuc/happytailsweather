# Happy Tails Weather - Splash Screen Implementation

## Overview
The Happy Tails Weather app now features a dynamic splash screen that provides a welcoming and context-aware experience for users.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Dynamic Message System
The splash screen displays different messages based on:
- **Time of day** (when weather data is not yet available)
- **Current weather conditions** (when weather data is available)

#### Time-based Messages:
- **5 AM - 10 AM**: "Ready for walkies? Let's check if it's safe! 🌅"
- **10 AM - 5 PM**: "Time for an adventure? Let's make it safe! ☀️"
- **5 PM - 9 PM**: "Evening stroll? We've got you covered! 🌆"
- **9 PM - 5 AM**: "Late night potty break? Let's keep it safe! 🌙"

#### Weather-based Messages:
- **Clear/Sunny**: "Perfect day for tails wagging! ☀️"
- **Cloudy**: "Clouds won't stop the fun! Let's walk safe ☁️"
- **Rainy**: "Wet paws ahead! Let's keep them safe 🌧️"
- **Snow**: "Snow zoomies? Let's check if it's safe! ❄️"
- **Thunderstorm**: "Stormy weather! Let's wait for better conditions ⚡"
- **Fog/Mist**: "Foggy adventure? Let's keep it safe! 🌫️"
- **Hot (>85°F)**: "Hot paws alert! Let's time this right 🥵"
- **Cold (<32°F)**: "Brrr! Time to check if your pup needs a coat 🧥"

### 2. First Launch Detection
- Uses `@AppStorage("hasLaunchedBefore")` to track first launch
- Shows "Welcome to Happy Tails!" header only on first launch
- Subsequent launches show only the dynamic message

### 3. Animations
- **Tail wagging animation**: Dog icon rotates with smooth easing
- **Message fade-in**: Messages appear with scale and opacity animations
- **Smooth transitions**: 2.5-second display with fade-out transition

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- Weather data loads asynchronously in background during splash
- Message updates every 1.5 seconds to show weather data when available
- Non-blocking implementation that doesn't delay app launch

## Technical Implementation

### Files Created/Modified:
1. **`SplashScreenView.swift`** - New splash screen view
2. **`ContentView.swift`** - Modified to show splash before main content
3. **`MainTabView.swift`** - Updated to accept services as parameters

### Key Components:
- **State Management**: Proper SwiftUI state handling for animations and transitions
- **Service Integration**: Seamless integration with existing WeatherService and LocationService
- **Animation System**: Custom animations using SwiftUI's animation framework
- **Message Logic**: Intelligent message selection based on time and weather context

### Architecture:
```

├── SplashScreenView (showingSplash = true)
│   ├── WeatherService (shared)
│   ├── LocationService (shared)
│   └── Dynamic message logic
└── MainTabView (showingSplash = false)
